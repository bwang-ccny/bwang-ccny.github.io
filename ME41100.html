<h1>ME 41100 - System Dynamics and Control (Fall 2023)</h1>
</div>
<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>This is a fundamental undergraduate course on the classical theory of dyanmic systems and control. It provides an introduction to mathematical modeling, analysis, and control of dynamic systems. The course emphasizes the frequency-domain techniques for the analysis of dynamic systems and the synthesis of control laws meeting given design specifications. Some familiarity with linear algebra, as well as ordinary differential equations (ODEs), is strongly recommended, although the necessary material will be reviewed in the context of the course.</p>

<h2>Textbook</h2>
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>All students are subject to the university's academic integrity policies. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated in any form. I will strongly adhere to the <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/it/academic-integrity-policy">CUNY Policy on Academic Interity</a>, should the need arise. Instances of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Copying solutions from other students during homework or during exams. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Solutions from previous years: It is forbidden to look at or copy solutions for homework from previous years. There are certain questions that are asked from year to year because they are good questions: doing these questions yourself will assist in your understanding of the course material and will be crucial in your in-class tests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You are encouraged to work with other students on your assignments, and to help other students complete their assignments, provided that you comply with the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Honest representation: The material you turn in for course credit must be a fair representation of your work. You are responsible for understanding and being able to explain and duplicate the work you submit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Give help appropriately: When helping someone, it is important not to simply give them a solution, because then they may not understand it fully and will not be able to solve a similar problem next time. It's always important to take the time to help someone think through the problem and develop the solution. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Copyright Policy</h2>
<p>All course materials (class lectures and discussions, handouts, examinations, web materials) and the intellectual content of the course itself are protected by United States Federal Copyright Law. Students (and all other persons) are forbiden from recording lectures or discussions and from distributing or selling lectures notes and all other course materials without the prior written permission of the instructor. Students are permitted to make notes solely for their own private educational use. Exceptions to accommodate students with disabilities may be granted with appropriate documentation. </p>
