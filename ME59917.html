<h2>Textbooks and Reference Materials</h2>
<p>The main textbook for the course will be:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mark W. Spong, Seth Hutchinson, and M. Vidyasagar, <i>Robot Modeling and Control</i>, 2nd ed., Wiley.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other optional references for the course's materials are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>John J. Craig, <i>Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control</i>, 4th ed., Pearson.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Kevin M. Lynch, and Frank C. Park, <i>Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control</i>, Cambridge.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hassan K. Khalil, <i>Nonlinear Systems</i>, 3rd ed., Prentice Hall.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some subjects may not be covered by the textbooks. Class attendance is required to prepare for exams and projects.
</p>
<h2>Grading &amp; Exam Policy </h2>
<p>Your grade will be assigned roughly according to the following percentages.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Two exams: 25% \(\times\) 2 = 50%
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Projects and assignments: 20%
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Term project* (including presentation): 30%
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Two exams will occur during the course's regular time slot. Exams will be <b>closed books</b> and <b>closed notes</b>. 
</p>
<p>No late homework will be accepted. If answers are not accompanied by satisfactory explanations (e.g., all intermediate steps, clearly readable handwriting), no credit will be given.
</p>
<p>(Materials submitted after the due date will not be graded. Final course grades will be submitted to the Registrar on the same day of the final exam.)
</p>
<p>*Students either choose an approved robot model or a robot model will be assigned for the term project during the first month. Students are expected to derive the kinematic and dynamic models of the assigned robot and derive a nonlinear multivariable control law for their robots. Simulation results must be presented to verify that the robot can successfully follow commanded trajectories using the nonlinear control law.

</p>
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>All students are subject to the university's academic integrity policies. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated in any form. I will strongly adhere to the <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/it/academic-integrity-policy" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity</a>, should the need arise. Instances of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Copying solutions from other students during homework or during exams. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Solutions from previous years: It is forbidden to look at or copy solutions for homework from previous years. There are certain questions that are asked from year to year because they are good questions: doing these questions yourself will assist in your understanding of the course material and will be crucial in your in-class tests.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You are encouraged to work with other students on your assignments, and to help other students complete their assignments, provided that you comply with the following conditions:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Honest representation: The material you turn in for course credit must be a fair representation of your work. You are responsible for understanding and being able to explain and duplicate the work you submit.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Give help appropriately: When helping someone, it is important not to simply give them a solution, because then they may not understand it fully and will not be able to solve a similar problem next time. It's always important to take the time to help someone think through the problem and develop the solution. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Copyright Policy</h2>
<p>All course materials (class lectures and discussions, handouts, examinations, web materials) and the intellectual content of the course itself are protected by United States Federal Copyright Law. Students (and all other persons) are forbidden from recording lectures or discussions and from distributing or selling lecture notes and all other course materials without the prior written permission of the instructor. Students are permitted to make notes solely for their own private educational use. Exceptions to accommodate students with disabilities may be granted with appropriate documentation.
